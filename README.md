**📊 Key KPIs Tracked:**

1. Total Sales – Overall revenue generated from items sold.

2. Average Sales – Average revenue per sale.

3. Number of Items – Total count of different items sold.

4. Average Rating – Average customer satisfaction score.

**📈 Dashboard Features & Visualizations:**

The dashboard contains multiple charts and visuals to highlight meaningful patterns, including:

* Donut Charts for total sales by fat content and outlet size.

* Bar Charts to compare item-type performance.

* Stacked Column Charts for fat content by outlet.

* Line Charts for outlet establishment analysis over the years.

* Funnel Map to show geographical distribution of sales.

* Matrix Cards displaying all metrics by outlet type in a comparative grid.

* Filter Panel enabling dynamic filtering by location, outlet size, and item type.
